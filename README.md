# STARLIMS VS Code README

Extension provides Visual Studio Code integration with STARLIMS Enterprise Designer. Started as a fun project to brush up on Typescript and learn the Visual Studio Code
extensibility API. At this moment the extension is not published in the VS Marketplace as I'm continuing to add new features that will bring it closer to offering some 
actual value.

## Features

Features:

* Explore Enterprise Designer (Applications, Data Sources, Server Scripts and Client Scripts). 
* Preview code with syntax higlighting for Starlims Scripting Language, JavaScript and SQL.
* Download application code locally

TODO:
* Check-in / Check-out items
* Local vs remote code diff view
* Advanced Intellisense support for SSL and StarLIMS Javascript extensions
* Others
